\emph{The use of GPS navigators in cars has increased considerably, whether dedicated devices or smartphone. However these navigators often do not take into account the current traffic situation in their estimated time to drive to destination.}

\emph{Nowadays smartphones have, besides the GPS antenna, internet connection 3G. You can use these devices in order to obtain or send the latest traffic information in a mutual collaboration between people.}

\emph{The work described here aims to develop a system to iPhone's platform, allowing traffic information to be exchanged in a collaborative manner among its users. The traffic information is collected automatically from the devices and it is displayed to all users.}
